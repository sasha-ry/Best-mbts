              <h3>Description</h3>

              <p>
                The production of the T-90 began in 1992 and the tank entered service with the Russian Army in 1993.
                An improved variant, the T-90A, entered service in 2004.
                Till present, more than 3,200 T-90 main battle tanks have been built.
                T-90 MBT had a price per unit of USD 2.5 million in 1999, and USD 2.77 - 4.25 million in 2011.
                The cost per unit of the improved T-90MS was USD 4.5 Million in 2016.
                The mass of the T-90 tanks varies by variants. The standard T-90 model has a weight of 46 tonnes (45
                long tons; 51 short tons), the T-90A version weights 46.5 tonnes (45.8 long tons; 51.3 short tons), and
                the newer T-90MS model has a mass of 48 tonnes (47 long tons; 53 short tons).
                The hull of the T-90 has a length of 6.86 m (22 ft 6 in), while the overall length of the tank including
                the barrel is 9.63 m (31 ft 7 in).
                It has a width of 3.78 m (12 ft 5 in) and a height of 2.22 m (7 ft 3 in).
                T-90 main battle tank has a crew of three (3) persons.
                The standard T-90 variant has a 125 mm 2A46M smoothbore gun with 43 rounds.
                The T-90A uses a 125 mm 2A46M-2 smoothbore gun with 42 rounds, while the T-90M has a 125 mm 2A82-1M
                smoothbore gun.
                As secondary armament, T-90 tanks are fitted with a 12.7 mm Kord heavy machine gun and a 7.62 mm PKMT
                machine gun.
                The standard T-90 tanks are powered by an 840 hp (618 kW) V-84MS 12-cyl. diesel engine.
                T-90A uses a more powerful 950 hp (736 kW) V-92S2 12-cyl. diesel engine, with the T-90MS having an even
                more powerful 1,130 hp (831 kW) V-92S2F engine.
                The T-90 has a power-to-weight ratio of 18.2 hp/tonne (13.3 kW/tonne), while T-90A has 20.4 hp/tonne (15
                kW/tonne).
                Having a torsion bar suspension, the T-90 MBT has an operational range of 550 km (340 mi) on internal
                fuel and a maximum speed of 60 km/h (37 mph).

                The T-80U is an improved version of the Russian-made T-80 MBT (Main Battle Tank) that entered into
                service with the Russian army in 1985. The production of the T-80U was stopped in 1992 but Ukraine
                continued to produce the tank. The tank has improved armor protection, a new 125 mm gun, and a
                fire-control system that allows the tank commander or gunner to aim and fire the main armament.

              <p>
                The development of Type 10 main battle tank begun in the 1990s.
                The goal was to develop a new generation main battle tank that will complement and eventually replace
                the Type 74 and Type 90 main battle tanks in the inventory of JGSDF.
                The prototype was built by the Technology Research and Development Institute (TRDI) and was revealed to
                the public on February 13, 2008.
                Type 10 MBT entered production in 2010 and a total of 106 Type 10 tanks were built between 2010 and
                2020.
                Type 10 has a C4I (Command, Control, Communication, and Computing) system that enables the sharing of
                information with other tanks on the battlefield.
                The Type 10 tank has a continuously variable transmission which allows it to reach a speed of 70 km/h
                both forward and backward.
                The new Japanese tank has a hydropneumatic active suspension that absorbs the recoil effect when the gun
                fires and it also helps the tank to better adjust its stance when driving off-road.
                Among the new Type 10's features is the capability of 360° vision coverage provided by day and night
                sights mounted around the turret. These sights also provide data to the C4I system.
                In 2008 the development costs for the Type 10 were estimated at $450 million and the unit price at $6.5
                million, reaching $8.4 million in 2014.
                The Type 10 was specially designed to have smaller dimensions so it can be easily transported all over
                Japan.
                It has five wheels on each side and its dimensions are 9.485 m in length, 3.24 m in width, and 2.30 m in
                height.
                Type 10 tank weighs 40 tonnes in basic loadout and can reach a maximum mass of 48 tonnes in full
                loadout.
                The armor consists of nano-crystal steel and modular ceramic composite armor.
                Type 10 has a 120 mm smoothbore cannon indigenously developed by Japan Steel Works. The gun has an
                autoloader and a capacity of 36 rounds.
                A new APFSDS round was specially developed for the new tank, and the Type 10 can also fire the normal
                JM33 APFSDS and 120 mm NATO rounds.
                As secondary armament, Type 10 has a 12.7 mm M2HB heavy machine gun and a 7.62 mm Type 74 machine gun.
                Type 10 is powered by a 1,200 hp, 4-stroke, 22.6-liter V8 diesel engine rated at 2,300 rpm, and has a
                power-to-weight ratio of 27 hp/tonne.
                This new generation Japanese main battle tank has an operational range of 500 km and can reach a maximum
                speed of 70 km/h.

                The Stridsvagn 122A is the Swedish first subvariant for the Leopard 2A5, which is the sixth variant of the Leopard 2 main battle tank family. The Stridsvagn 122A is distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 largely by the French GALIX smoke dispensers, different storage bins, and thicker crew hatches. Everything else remains the same as on standard Leopard 2A5. The Leopard 2A5 (launched in mid-1998) differs from previous variants in appearance due to the addition of wedge-shaped spaced add-on armour over the entire front as well as the forward sides of the turret. This wedge-shaped space add-on armour is designed to deflect and erode kinetic-energy penetrators as well as neutralize a hollow charge before it reaches the base armour. The shot-trap effect was investigated and avoided as a result of the first layer, which does not deflect penetrators into the hull, as well as angle calculations and the material utilized for the outer layer. As a result, the gun mantlet had been altered to accommodate the new wedge-shaped spaced add-on armour. In addition, the complete composite armour composition has been altered and improved. Spall liners were fitted in the crew compartment to prevent fragmentation, and the frontal area of the side skirts was upgraded and fortified. The turret traverse and systems were completely electric to decrease weight and simplify maintenance and reliability. The tank commander's vision was placed beyond the hatch, and thermal imaging equipment was fitted separately. The gunner's sight was also moved to the turret roof (earlier versions had it incorporated into the front turret armour cavity). The driver's hatch has been modified as well. The entire gun brake system was updated because this type was scheduled to be upgraded to the new 120 mm Rheinmetall L/55 tank gun in the future Leopard 2A6 variant.
